# PyIEX - A Python IEX API Wrapper w/ Extra Utilities

**OBJECTIVE:** This repository aims to provide a wrapper with extra utilities for the [IEX API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/).

**NOTICE:** This project is currently **IN DEVELOPMENT**. The master branch has been tested for functionality, but I may have missed some things!
_Please let me know if you find any bugs or if you have feature requests!_

**NEED HELP?** Check out the wiki for documentation. It's rather lacking in details, but it should give you an idea of what was
going through my mind when I added a certain function.

This project uses IEX's API for all data. As such, I am obligated to disclaim the following: **“Data provided for free by [IEX](https://iextrading.com/developer). [View IEX’s Terms of Use](https://iextrading.com/api-exhibit-a/).”**
